    <p id="about-me" style="font-size:1rem;"> This site is an attempt to fill in the gaps that I may have lost in translation while studying Computer Science: Language Technology in Norway. <br><br> The notes are in English, but some of the extra resources linked may be in Norwegian. <br><br> While the main goal is to revise NLP concepts, I'm also using this as a way of getting some hands-on practice with front-end development tools, and to have an excuse to make and post some silly drawings. <br><br> If you are reading this, I hope this site will be useful for you too! </p>

Supervised learning currently gives us the most precise results, but it is costly to label data manually. Unsupervised learning is to use an algorithm to analyze and cluster unlabelled data into predefined classes.">

            alt="A Bag of Words is a type of data representation in Machine Learning. It represents each document by their unordered collection of word types, and their number count. It is used in vector space models, where document similarity is computed by the distance of the document vectors in the space. Each dimension in this space corresponds to a word in the vocabulary. However, there are problems with this representation: Two sentences may have the same Bag of Words, but different meaning, such as 'I was impressed, this was not bad' and 'I was not impressed, this was bad'. Another problem is that it keeps track of the number of words, but there is no information sharing between the features, so we may have sentences that refer to the same entity, but that have different Bag of Words, such as 'The pizza was great', and 'The margheritta was awesome'. This can be solved by using N-grams instead.">
